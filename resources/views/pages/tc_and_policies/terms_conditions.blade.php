            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">CezAgora</h3>

            <p class="mb-2">You are entering into this Contract with Cezius Link, the sole owner and representative of CezAgora (also referred to as “we” and “us”) and Cezius Link will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">This Contract applies to Subscribers and Visitors.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">As a Visitor or Subscriber of our Services, the collection, use, and sharing of your personal data is subject to our

If we make material changes to it, we will provide you with notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you with the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any changes, you may close your account. Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you consent to the updated terms as of their effective date.</p>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Rights and Limits</h3>

            <p class="mb-2">3.1 Your License to CezAgora</p>

            <p class="mb-2">You own all of the content, feedback, and personal information you provide to us, but you also grant us a non-exclusive license to it.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">We’ll honor the choices you make about who gets to see your information and content, including how it can be used for ads.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">As between you and Cezius Link, you own the content and information that you submit or post to the Services, and you are only granting Cezius Link and our affiliates the following non-exclusive license:</p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-2">
                <li>A worldwide, transferable, and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publish, and process, information and content that you provide through our Services and the services of others, without any further consent, notice, and/or compensation to you or others.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mb-2">These rights are limited in the following ways:</p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-2">
                <li>You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you shared it with others as part of the Service and they copied, re-shared it or stored it and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.</li>
                <li>We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, we have the right, without payment to you or others, to serve ads near your content and information. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.</li>
                <li>We will get your consent if we want to give others the right to publish your content beyond the Services. However, if you choose to share your post as "public, everyone or similar", we will enable search engines to make that public content findable through their services.</li>
                <li>While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying the size, layout or file type or removing metadata), we will not modify the meaning of your expression.</li>
                <li>Because you own your content and information and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license.</li>
                <li>You and Cezius Link agree that if content includes personal data, it is subject to our Privacy Policy.</li>

                <li>You promise to only provide information and content that you have the right to share, and that your CezAgora profile will be truthful.</li>
                <li>You agree to only provide content or information that does not violate the law nor anyone’s rights (including intellectual property rights). You also agree that your profile information will be truthful. Cezius Link reserves the right to remove certain information or content if it is not truthful. Cezius Link may be required by law to remove certain information or content in certain countries.</li>

            <p class="mb-2">We have the right to limit how you interact on our Services.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">Cezius Link reserves the right to limit your use of the Services.

            <p class="mb-2">3.5 Intellectual Property Rights</p>

            <p class="mb-2">We’re providing you with notice about our intellectual property rights.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">We use data and information about you to make relevant suggestions to you and others.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">We use the information and data that you provide and that we have about Subscribers to make recommendations for products, services, and features that may be useful to you. For example, we use data and information about you to recommend new products and services to you. Keeping your profile accurate and up to date helps us to make these recommendations more accurate and relevant.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">Disclaimer and Limit of Liability</p>

            <p class="mb-2">4.1 No Warranty</p>

            <p class="mb-2">This is our disclaimer of legal liability for the quality, safety, or reliability of our Services.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">CEZIUS LINK AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY ABOUT THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES (INCLUDING CONTENT AND INFORMATION) ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CEZIUS LINK AND ITS AFFILIATES DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE, ACCURACY OF DATA, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">4.2 Exclusion of Liability</p>

            <p class="mb-2">These are the limits of legal liability we may have to you.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW (AND UNLESS CEZIUS LINK HAS ENTERED INTO A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT THAT OVERRIDES THIS CONTRACT), CEZIUS LINK, INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES, WILL NOT BE LIABLE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT FOR LOST PROFITS OR LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REPUTATION (E.G., OFFENSIVE OR DEFAMATORY STATEMENTS), LOSS OF DATA (E.G., DOWN TIME OR LOSS, USE OF, OR CHANGES TO, YOUR INFORMATION OR CONTENT) OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">CEZIUS LINK AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT FOR ANY AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDS (A) THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO CEZIUS LINK FOR THE SERVICES DURING THE TERM OF THIS CONTRACT, IF ANY, OR (B) US $100.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">4.3 Basis of the Bargain; Exclusions</p>

            <p class="mb-2">The limitations of liability in this Section 4 are part of the basis of the bargain between you and Cezius Link and shall apply to all claims of liability (e.g., warranty, tort, negligence, contract and law) even if Cezius Link or its affiliates has been told of the possibility of any such damage, and even if these remedies fail their essential purpose.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">These limitations of liability do not apply to liability for death or personal injury or for fraud, gross negligence or intentional misconduct, or in cases of negligence where a material obligation has been breached, a material obligation being such which forms a prerequisite to our delivery of services and on which you may reasonably rely, but only to the extent that the damages were directly caused by the breach and were foreseeable upon conclusion of this Contract and to the extent that they are typical in the context of this Contract.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">Termination</p>

            <p class="mb-2">We can each end this Contract, but some rights and obligations survive.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">Both you and Cezius Link may terminate this Contract at any time with notice to the other. On termination, you lose the right to access or use the Services. The following shall survive termination:</p>

            <ul class="mb-2">
                <li>Our rights to use and disclose your feedback;</li>
                <li>Sections 4, 6, 7, and 8.2 of this Contract;</li>
                <li>Any amounts owed by either party prior to termination remain owed after termination.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mb-2">Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</p>

            <p class="mb-2">In the unlikely event we end up in a legal dispute, depending on where you live, you and Cezius Link agree to resolve it in Romanian courts using Romanian law, or in your local courts using local law, if this is the case.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">The laws of Romania govern all claims related to Cezius Link's provision of the Services, but this shall not deprive you of the mandatory consumer protections under the law of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence. With respect to jurisdiction, you and Cezius Link agree to choose the courts of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence for all disputes arising out of or relating to this User Agreement, or in the alternative, you may choose the responsible court in Romania.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">General Terms</p>

            <p class="mb-2">Here are some important details about the Contract.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it unenforceable, you and we agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court cannot do that, you and we agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Contract.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">This Contract (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that Cezius Link has waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign or transfer this Contract (or your subscribership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that Cezius Link may assign this Contract to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Contract.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">You agree that the only way to provide us with legal notice is at the addresses provided in Section 10.</p>
