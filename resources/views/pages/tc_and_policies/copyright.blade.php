                <p class="mb-4">Cezius Link as the sole owner and representative of CezAgora respects the intellectual property rights of others and desires to offer a platform which contains no content that violates those rights. Our User Agreement requires that information posted by Subscribers be accurate, lawful and not in violation of the rights of third parties. To promote these objectives, CezAgora provides a process for submission of complaints concerning content posted by our Subscribers. Our policy and procedures are described and/or referenced in the sections that follow.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Please note that whether or not we disable access to or remove content, Cezius Link as the sole owner and representative of CezAgora may make a good faith attempt to forward the written notification, including the complainant’s contact information, to the Subscriber who posted the content and/or take other reasonable steps to notify the Subscriber that CezAgora has received notice of an alleged violation of intellectual property rights or other content violation. It is also our policy, in appropriate circumstances and in our discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of Subscribers, or groups as the case may be, who infringe or repeatedly infringe the rights of others or otherwise post unlawful content.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Please note that any notice or counter-notice you submit must be truthful and must be submitted under penalty of perjury. A false notice or counter-notice may give rise to personal liability. You may therefore want to seek the advice of legal counsel before submitting a notice or a counter-notice.</p>
