            <p class="mb-2">How we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your settings. We use the data that we have about you to provide and personalize our Services, including with the help of automated systems and inferences we make, so that our Services (including ads) can be more relevant and useful to you and others.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">3.1 Services</p>

            <p class="mb-2">Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional and business topics you care about, and from companies of interest. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant products, services or events on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest companies and ads that might interest you in pursuing your next business opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a business or category of products (e.g., by searching preferences), we will use this information to personalize adds or suggest related events to help you towards growing your business. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name, to provide notices to others. For example, subject to your settings, we may notify others that you have updated your products or services.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">3.1.2 Productivity</p>

            <p class="mb-2">Our Services allow you to collaborate with other Subscribers to search for potential better deals in purchasing products or services.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">3.2 Communications</p>

            <p class="mb-2">We contact our Subscribers and we offer settings to control what messages you receive and how often you receive some types of messages.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">We will contact you through email, mobile phone, , and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues.

Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us, including security and legal notices.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">3.3 Advertising</p>

            <p class="mb-2">We serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing other ads.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Subscribers, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:</p>

            <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
                <li>Data from advertising technologies on and off our Services, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and device identifiers;</li>

            <p class="mb-4">3.3.1 Ad Choices</p>

            <p class="mb-2">We adhere to self-regulatory principles for interest-based advertising and participate in industry opt-outs from such ads. This does not opt you out of receiving advertising; you will continue to get other ads by advertisers not listed with these self-regulatory tools. You can also opt-out specifically from our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">3.3.2 Info to Ad Providers</p>

            <p class="mb-2">We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. In such instances, we seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit opt-in consent before doing so.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">3.4 Developing Services and Research</p>

            <p class="mb-2">We develop our Services and conduct research.</p>

We attempt to notify Subscribers about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">4.5 Change in Control or Sale</p>

            <p class="mb-2">We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">5.1 Data Retention</p>

            <p class="mb-2">We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases, we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">5.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data</p>

            <p class="mb-2">You can access or delete your personal data. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used, and shared.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">For personal data that we have about you, you can:</p>

                <li>Delete Data: You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you).</li>
                <li>Change or Correct Data: You can edit some of your personal data through your account. You can also ask us to change, update, or fix your data in certain cases, particularly if it’s inaccurate.</li>

                <li>Right to Access and/or Take Your Data: You can ask us for a copy of your personal data and can ask for a copy of personal data you provided in machine-readable form.</li>

            <p class="mb-2">We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have restricted your account for breach of our CezAgora Marketplace Policy), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to "unsubscribe" from further messages from us. We will retain depersonalized information after your account has been closed.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">Information you have shared with others (e.g., Reviews) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Subscribers have copied out of our Services. Review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search engine results) until they refresh their cache.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Other Important Information</p>

            <p class="mb-2">6.1. Security</p>

            <p class="mb-2">We process data both inside and outside of Romania and rely on legally provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders. Countries where we process data may have laws which are different from, and potentially not as protective as, the laws of your own country.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">6.3 Lawful Bases for Processing</p>

            <p class="mb-2">We have lawful bases to collect, use, and share data about you. You have choices about our use of your data. At any time, you can withdraw consent you have provided by going to settings or terminate your account.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">We will only collect and process personal data about you where we have lawful bases. Lawful bases include consent (where you have given consent), contract (where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you (e.g., to deliver the CezAgora Services you have requested) and “legitimate interests.”</p>
