Any browser visiting our sites may receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or service providers. We or third parties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-CezAgora sites that display ads or that host our plugins.
                            We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to CezAgora and interact with our Services without signing in again. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by CezAgora when you return to one of our sites or visit a third-party site that uses our Services. Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).

            <p>
                DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. As such, CezAgora does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.
